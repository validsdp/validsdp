Prerequisites
-------------

In addition to the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.7), you need the following
libraries:

- Mathematical Components (>= 1.6, http://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/)
- Flocq (>= 3.0, http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/)
- Coquelicot (>= 3.0, http://coquelicot.saclay.inria.fr/)
- BigNums (https://github.com/coq/bignums/)

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the git repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
git, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && ./remake --jobs=2 && ./remake install

The environment variable COQC can be passed to the configure script in order
to set the Coq compiler command. The configure script defaults to "coqc".
Similarly, COQDEP can be used to specify the location of "coqdep". The
COQBIN environment variable can be used to set both variables at once.

Option "--libdir=DIR" sets the directory where the compiled library files
should be installed by "./remake install". By default, the target directory
is "`$COQC -where`/user-contrib/Interval".

The files are compiled at a logical location starting with "Interval".
