2015-12-04 small renaming
2015-12-04 Finished all proofs in Interval_integral, except one. The remaining proof needs the fact that I.join is symmetrical, which it isn't as concerns its specification.

2015-11-24 proof of integrability
2015-11-24 Up to seemingly reasonable admits, proved continuity.
2015-11-23 First attempt to build the complete proof by induction on the program. The statement of the intermediary lemma continuousProg may be too strong. To be continued.

2015-11-23 finished proof of continuity for unary ops under some assumptions, but big progress has been made

2015-10-08 potentially resolved unwanted dependencies
2015-10-08 Filled some blanks and slightly changed integral_correct, modified. tactic file. It is now more general and needs for f to be integrable between any x1 \in ia and x2 \in ib. This is only fair if we're going to approximate all such integrals.
2015-10-08 Added two missing lemmas about extended reals: - Lemma le_lower_refl (r : R) : le_lower (Xreal r) (Xreal r). - Lemma le_upper_refl (r : R) : le_upper (Xreal r) (Xreal r). They could not be put directly into Interval_xreal.v because the functions le_lower and le_upper are not defined in that file. Maybe this should all move back to Interval_xreal.v?
