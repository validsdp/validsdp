                The Coq Effective Algebra Library - CoqEAL
=================================================================================

In order to compile this library, you have to set three environment variables:
  - COQBIN should be the path to Coq's binaries (coqc, coqdep,...)
  - SSRSRC should be the path to the ssreflect "src" folder
    (in which ssreflect.cmxs can be found).
  - SSRLIB should be the path to ssr theories (where the .vo files are)

To set environment variables, you may use a command like:
export SSRSRC=/path/...

and then type `make` to compile.

Note: the makefile assumes you are using a dynamically linked version of the
ssreflect plugin. If this is not the case, you need to adapt the `Make` file.
