Content
-------

refinements  -  Classes  for  refinements and  refines  together  with
              operational typeclasses for common operations.

binnat - Proof that the binary naturals  of Coq (N) is a refinement of
         SSReflect   unary   naturals   (nat)  together   with   basic
         operations.

binint  -  SSReflect integers  (ssrint)  are  refined  to a  new  type
          paremetrized  by positive  numbers (represented  by a  sigma
          type) and  natural numbers.  This  means that proofs  can be
          done  using only  lemmas  from the  SSReflect library  which
          leads to  simpler proofs  than previous versions  of binint.
          (e.g. N).

rational - The rational numbers of SSReflect (rat) is refined to pairs
           of  elements  refining   integers  using  parametricity  of
           refinements.

seqmatrix - First and incomplete  attempt to refine SSReflect matrices
            ('M[R]_(m,n)) to lists of lists (seq (seq R)).
	    (partially working (work in progress))
	    
seqpoly - First and incomplete attempt to refine SSReflect polynomials
          ({poly R}) to lists (seq R).
	  (partially working (work in progress))

... - to be documented.
