Installation
------------

Most of the dependencies (Coq, mathcomp, Flocq, Coquelicot and
CoqInterval) can be easily installed with OPAM
(https://opam.ocaml.org). Once OPAM is installed, type

% opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
% opam install ocamlfind zarith coq.8.5.2 coq-interval

Paramcoq, CoqEAL and multinomials have to be retrieved from their Git
repository:

% git clone https://github.com/drouhling/paramcoq.git
% git clone https://github.com/CoqEAL/CoqEAL.git
% git clone https://github.com/math-comp/multinomials.git

then follow their respective installation instructions (usually make
and make install, in both subdirectories theory and refinements for
CoqEAL).

OSDP can be downloaded from (https://cavale.enseeiht.fr/osdp), then
follow the instructions in the INSTALL file (only the SDPA dependency
is required (Debian package sdpa for instance), in particular CSDP,
Mosek, camlp4 and ocaml-glpk are not mandatory).

The installation of ValidSDP itself can then proceed, first with the
OCaml plugin:

% cd plugins/soswitness/
% make
% make install  # possibly as root (but probably not if you installed Coq via OPAM)
% cd ../..

Then with the Coq tactic:

% cd theories
% make -j2
% make install  # possibly as root (but probably not if you installed Coq via OPAM)
% cd ..

Usage
-----

Examples of usage of the tactic can be found at the end of the
validsdp.v file.

Documentation
-------------

To generate documentation from the Coq code:

% cd theories
% make doc

The documentation can then be browsed from html/toc.html with
your favorite browser.
