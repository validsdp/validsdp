Installation
------------

Most of the dependencies (Coq, mathcomp, Flocq, Coquelicot and
CoqInterval) can be easily installed with OPAM
(https://opam.ocaml.org). Once OPAM is installed, type

% opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
% opam install ocamlfind zarith coq coq-interval coq-mathcomp-algebra

OSDP can be downloaded from (https://cavale.enseeiht.fr/osdp), then
follow the instructions in the INSTALL file (only the SDPA dependency
is required (Debian package sdpa for instance), in particular CSDP,
Mosek, camlp4 and ocaml-glpk are not mandatory).

To check that you have these dependencies properly installed, you can run:

% ./configure

Then, build and install Paramcoq, CoqEAL, and multinomials by typing:

% make external

Finally, build and install ValidSDP by typing:

% make install

Usage
-----

Examples of usage of the tactic can be found at the end of the
validsdp.v file.

Documentation
-------------

To generate documentation from the Coq code:

% cd theories
% make doc

The documentation can then be browsed from html/toc.html with
your favorite browser.
