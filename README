Installation
============

Most of the dependencies (Coq, mathcomp, Flocq, Coquelicot and
CoqInterval) can be easily installed with Opam
(https://opam.ocaml.org). Once Opam is installed, type

% opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
% opam install ocamlfind zarith coq-interval

Paramcoq, CoqEAL and multinomials have to be retrieved from their git
repository

% git clone https://github.com/drouhling/paramcoq.git
% git clone https://github.com/CoqEAL/CoqEAL.git
% git clone https://github.com/math-comp/multinomials.git

then follow their respective installation instructions (usually make
and make install, in both subdirectories theory and refinements for
CoqEAL).

OSDP can be downloaded from (https://cavale.enseeiht.fr), then follow
the instructions in the INSTALL file (only the SDPA dependency is
required (Debian package sdpa for instance), in particular CSDP,
Mosek, camlp4 and ocaml-glpk are not mandatory).

The installation of ValidSDP itself can then procceed, first with the
OCaml plugin

% cd plugins/soswitness/
% make
% make install  # possibly as root (but probably not if you installed Coq via Opam)
% cd ../..

Then with the Coq tactic

% cd theories
% make -j2
% make install  # possibly as root (but probably not if you installed Coq via Opam)
% cd ..

Usage
=====

Examples of usage of the tactic can be found at the end of the
validsdp.v file.

Documentation
=============

Documentation of the Coq code

% cd theories
% make doc

the documentations can then be browsed from from html/toc.html with
yout favorite browser.
